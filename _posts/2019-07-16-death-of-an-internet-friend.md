A few weeks ago a friend of mine passed away suddenly.

It's strange when you meet someone online.  They have this timeless almost ethereal quality in your mind because you don't ever expect to meet them in person.  And then you do.

I met Matt over ten years ago while I was playing a zombie survival game called Left 4 Dead.  At the time I was running server instances for the game on a linux box in my basement.  I would particpate in some of the games on those instances.  It was in the lobby for one of them that I would meet him.  Over crackly voice chat we slowly got to know each other as we always joined each other's games when there was an opening.

I got to know home a little better over time.  He was a government worker who lived in Virginia and had a technical background.  He was five years my senior and had a sense of humor that jived with my own.  He was conservative and we would clash on more than a few topics.

When he greeted me every time I joined our shared voice chat he would consistently respond with "herro".  It was a dumb quirk that infected me.  I began using it to replace "hello" at every available opportunity and it's something I'll probably never stop doing.

Although separated by several hundred miles, we managed to catch up with eachother three times in real life.  The first was at a LAN party that I hosted one weekend.  My roommate and I invited several guys down to stay at our apartment while we all overloaded some power outlets and played some games together.  I'll never forget when Matt arrived to that event.  He had brought his 18 inch CRT monitor.  As he both did our best to haul this gargantuan monitor up the flight of stairs to my aparment he was explaining to me how the refresh rate on the CRT made all the difference.

The second time we met was when I was driving home from the Outer Banks in North Carolina after vacation.  I stopped off at his house where we hung out and he showed me how to overclock a computer.  I watched as he ran several diagnostics to test the new processor he had cranked up to some irresponsible clock speed.  I just remember being impressed by his skillset.  Even though I had a technical background I still marvelled at how he knew how to do all these things.

The third time I saw him was at his wedding where I came down with my wife and friend to attend a reception at the Waldorf hotel near the Whitehouse.  It was a lavish wedding and I met some interesting people there, but unfortunately the marriage didn't last through no fault of his own.

We weren't close by any stretch of the imagination, but he definitely had an effect on my life.  I'll do my best though to carry his quirks and idiosyncracies with me as I hurtle through life.  And to always overclock my builds in his honor.  Good night, [baffula](https://steamcommunity.com/id/baffula){:target="_blank"}, you goddamned sweet prince.  May your Steam page stand in all its glory and inspire the next generation of nerds.  We'll miss you buddy.
