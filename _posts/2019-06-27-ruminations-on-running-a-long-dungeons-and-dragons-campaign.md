I did not become a dungeon master until the fall of 2016.  Fifth edition had just dropped and I was checking the pulse on a few of my friends to see if they'd be interested in getting a game going.  In order to grease the wheels a bit, I offered to run the game.  After writing the initial campaign notes and back story during some of my honeymoon, we scheduled the first session. I had played version 3.5 briefly but had no previous DM experience.  I was now sitting down to try and corral a group of six willing subjects.  That game would stretch into a [four part, two and a half year journey](https://glrel.fandom.com/wiki/Glrel_Wiki){:target="_blank"}.
