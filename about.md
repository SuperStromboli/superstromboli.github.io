I've been developing applications and websites for about 15 years.  Over that time I've worked with many technologies and throughout many industries.  My current day-to-day takes place at [Mathway](https://www.mathway.com){:target="_blank"} where you can find me engineering solutions for math students across the globe.

Other projects include maintaining a [showcase event](https://www.libertybellgames.com){:target="_blank"} and [scouting service](https://www.icehockeyinternational.com){:target="_blank"} for youth hockey on the east coast.

I am an avid Dungeons &amp; Dragons player and dungeon master.  Sometimes you can find me in alternate realities as either the questioning aasimar [Sulyman Quantarius Zoornastica Mushkin](https://ddb.ac/characters/4798328/lRMkUN){:target="_blank"} or the indomitable halfling [Goos](https://ddb.ac/characters/1975764/P0i0aq){:target="_blank"}.  When I have free time I love to cook, play video games and tinker on personal projects.  I live in Perkasie, PA with my wife and son.
